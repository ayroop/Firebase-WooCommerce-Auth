## Usage

**Shortcode**

Add the Firebase Authentication UI anywhere (e.g., a login/registration page):

```
[firebase_auth_ui]
```

This renders the Firebase Auth UI widget, letting users sign in via the enabled methods.

**Automatic Sync**

- New WooCommerce users are created if not already registered.
- Billing fields (name, email, phone) are auto-populated from Firebase profile.
- If no email (e.g., phone auth), a placeholder is used and the user is prompted to update it.
